# Meta Schema

This library contains the Pydantic models for the metadata schema standard outlined in this [Schema Guide](https://mah0001.github.io/schema-guide/).

The pydantic models for each data type will allow for an easy conversion across JSON, dict, and Python-objects (Pydantic model). Additionally, the metadata is also automatically validated using the expected field types to guarantee that the metadata is consistent.


# Install

The package is available on PyPi:

pip install metaschema
